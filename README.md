AndroidSoundboard
=================

An example of a soundboard for Android. Can play sounds and save them as either ringtones or alerts.

This project is created in Android Studio (http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) and you should be able
to run it directly by fetching the whole project.

You can try playing around with adding your own sounds and images. It contains a few test sounds of cow mooing, because cows 
are awesome.

I created this project because I wanted to learn how to develop Android applications, and figured this was as good of a start
as any. Please have a look at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hjorturls.jhs for an example of a soundboard
that was created using this structure.

Hope you have fun with it!
